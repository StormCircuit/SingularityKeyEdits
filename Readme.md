This fork is an edit of Blackrack's singularity shader. This fork was created solely to change the keybindings and experiment with a configuration file solution (if I get off my ass and actually do it).

Please see this repo for up-to-date info and support for Singularity: https://github.com/LGhassen/Singularity
